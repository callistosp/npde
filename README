This library can be used to compute prediction distribution errors (npde), a
metric designed to evaluate nonlinear mixed effect models.

Details concerning the computation of npde and the pre-requisite simulations can
be found in the User Guide (npde_userguide.pdf). An example of parameter
estimation and simulation is shown using the NONMEM software, but other
software, such as the library nlme in R can be used for both estimation and
simulation.
